The objective is to create a tool that helps TPMs and Pre-sales team for generating network Traffic Matrix based on any criteria they need
Here there is a pain where always when doing such activity ; its  consumed too much time and mainly we chooses one of the juniors to do such activity
I have created tool based on two phases ,
First phase ;the core code to be very simple ,and the final script to be working on any windows machine
Second phase ; I have adopted the code to be based on sequential functions ( clean code ) , so that I can be easily amendment it and enhance it for new features
Future enhancement , ( we can work together – if its okay for you – to enhance the current version and make it ready for generic business use
First room of enhancement is to make version ready for Linux so that it can be used in WS-NOC to generate the TM , also might communication through API is needed
Second room of enhancement is to add some AI feature to visualise the TM data , giving more understanding features and might be some suggestion for future expansion
Third room ; Adding extra filtration options which can help  in builds a generic tool  
4th enhancement : Comparison between various TM versions
